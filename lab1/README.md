### 1.Single Responsibility Principle - SRP: 
The `Enclosure`, `Food`, `Inventory`, `Animals`, and Employee classes are each responsible for different aspects of the system (the availability of enclosures, food processing, animal inventory, and employees, respectively).

### 2.Open-Closed Principle - OCP:
Adding new types of food, animals, workers, or enclosures is done without modifying existing classes

### 3.Interface Segregation Principle - ISP:
The `[Inventory](Inventory.cs)` and `[Employee](Employee.cs)` classes use only those methods and properties of the Animals class that they need.

### 4. DRY:
This principle is implemented in the code because there is no repetitive code. For example, creating animals and workers is done by calling constructors, rather than duplicating this code in each use.

### 5.Composition Over Inheritance:
The code uses composition, for example, the [Employee class](Employee.cs) contains a reference to the list of animals to feed, rather than inheriting their class.

### 6.YAGNI:
The code does not contain redundant functionality or functions that are not needed at the moment

### 7. KISS:
The code demonstrates the use of the KISS principle because it is simple, clear, and easy to understand and maintain.
